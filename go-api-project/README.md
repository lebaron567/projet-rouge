# Go API Project

This project is a simple API developed using the Chi router in Go. It serves as a demonstration of building a RESTful API with basic routing and request handling.

## Project Structure

```
go-api-project
├── cmd
│   └── server
│       └── main.go        # Entry point of the application
├── internal
│   ├── handlers
│   │   └── handler.go     # HTTP request handlers
│   ├── routes
│   │   └── routes.go      # API routes setup
│   └── models
│       └── model.go       # Data structures for the application
├── go.mod                  # Module definition and dependencies
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd go-api-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Go installed, then run:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   Navigate to the `cmd/server` directory and execute:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints. For example:

- **GET** `/api/resource` - Retrieves a list of resources.
- **POST** `/api/resource` - Creates a new resource.

Make sure to replace `/api/resource` with the actual routes defined in your application.
